==Registering an module==
  There are two modes of registering a module to a framework.
  * *Manual*: Adding an entry into vibz.reg file.
   * vibz.reg file will be located at your installed location (i.e where you have installed Vibz automation). example: for me its *C:\Program Files\Vibzworld\Automation Studio*.
   * Open this file and add the reference to your module under specific section.
  * *Through a zipped file*: In case you want to share your module with other user you can create a zip file. The installed Studio has a the Extension manager through which a user can easily register your module. This furthers supresses the complexity when your module itself is a big projects with multiple referenced files.
  To create a zip file you need to follow these steps.
   * Bundle all the module files in a folder.
   * Create a <name>.plg (any name) file in the same folder.
