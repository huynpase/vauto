==Scheduling Automation Script==
Although the process is automated, there is a need to initiate the execution. The framework has gone a step ahead to provide a facility to schedule your script execution at some regular interval or on some criteria fulfillment. This is useful in case of running a bot to crawl a site or starting a testing process when a new build arrives. 

This is yet another open end where the framework can be extended to provide your own custom scheduling. One can have as many scheduled event running in parallel.
