==Components of a Test script==
Before looking into Components of a test script you may want to look into the [http://code.google.com/p/vauto/ComponentsOfTestProject components of a Test Project]

Using Vibz automation framework, the development phase during automation majorily deals in scripting down the functional aspect of the application under test (AUT). Once the project is created (Ref: [http://code.google.com/p/vauto/wiki/StartingNewProject Starting a New Project]), you will only be concerned in modularizing the test script, by adding script files in self defined folder structure. 
__Note: The script can be maintained in folder structure specific to application feature.
